Project to utilize OpenAI's API and create a front-end and back-end for entering prompts

This is a project between two Tech Elevator students to use concepts learned during the boot camp. We will be creating a
front-end that looks similar to the website for ChatGPT and will use OpenAI's API to implement prompt functionality to the website.
Planning to use Java for the back-end portion, though may end up using Javascript. Still figuring that part out at the moment.
