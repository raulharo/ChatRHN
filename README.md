Project to utilize OpenAI's API and create a front-end and back-end for entering prompts

This is a project between two Tech Elevator students to use concepts learned during the boot camp. We will be creating a
front-end that looks similar to the website for ChatGPT and will use OpenAI's API to implement prompt functionality to the website.
This project is using Java to run the API calls and store the conversation. Will need to connect the front end with the back end
using custom server side endpoints that will call up the Java functions that were written.
