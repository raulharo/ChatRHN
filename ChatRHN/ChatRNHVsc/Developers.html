            <h3>
                Hey there! I'm Nicole Nguyen, an easy-going, friendly, and social individual. On my extra time <br>
                I enjoy playing Video games, special League Of Legends and TFT. I was introduced to coding early <br>
                on, by playing with MySpace and FaceBook. While I initially pursued a career in veterinary medicine <br>
                and medical field, I eventually realized it wasn't the right fit for me. Determined to follow my <br>
                passion, I enrolled in Tech Elevator's 14-week boot camp for softwareengineering.<br>
                <br>
                At Tech Elevator, I gained valuable experience as a full stack developer and had the pleasure of meeting <br>
                Raul. We both share a sarcastic sense of humor, which inspired me to create ChatRHN, a sassy version of <br>
                ChatGPT.With Raul's help my vision came true.<br>

            <h3>
                Hey there! I'm Raul Haro, a laidback individual who enjoys video games like Mother 3 and Killer7. I also
                love <br>
                exploring teas, capturing moments through photography, and bringing smiles to people's faces. By studying
                Computer <br>
                Science and completion of a full stack software development boot camp at Tech Elevator, my dream is to
                contribute <br>
                to a team that strives to produce a technology that would make a positive impact on the world at large. I'm
                also <br>
                interested in exploring music production to create some funky fresh tunes.<br>
