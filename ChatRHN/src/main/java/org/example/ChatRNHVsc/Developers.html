    <h2> Nicole Nguyen:  </h2>
    <h3>
    Hey there! I'm Nicole Nguyen, a Texan who was introduced to coding early on. While I initially <br>
    pursued a career in veterinary medicine, I eventually realized it wasn't the right fit for me. <br>
    Determined to follow my passion, I enrolled in Tech Elevator's 14-week boot camp for software engineering.<br>
    <br>
    At Tech Elevator, I gained valuable experience as a full stack developer and had the pleasure of meeting Raul.<br>
    We both share a sarcastic sense of humor, which inspired me to create ChatRHN, a sassy version of ChatGPT. <br>
    With Raul's help my vision came true<br>

    <h2>Raul Haro:</h2> <br>
    <h3>
        Hey there! I'm Raul Haro, a laidback individual who enjoys video games like Mother 3 and Killer7. I also love <br>
        exploring teas, capturing moments through photography, and bringing smiles to people's faces. By studying Computer <br>
        Science and completion of a full stack software development boot camp at Tech Elevator, my dream is to contribute <br>
        to a team that strives to produce a technology that would make a positive impact on the world at large. I'm also <br>
        interested in exploring music production to create some funky fresh tunes.<br>
